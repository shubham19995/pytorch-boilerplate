# pytorch-boilerplate
This repository will contain the boilerplate codes required to build a deep learning model in pytorch. I am trying to speed up the development process of pytorch deep learning. Any suggestions will be highly appreciated


The main parts of a deep learning model in pytorch is as follows: * *

*Training Part*
- Dataset Class
- Transforms
- DataLoader
- Network
- Training Loop
- Model Saver

*Prediction Part*
- Model Loader
- Single Example Predictor
- Batch Predictor

*Deploying Part*
- API BoilerPlate
